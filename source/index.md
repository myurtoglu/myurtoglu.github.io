The source code for the projects presented in the book is hosted on GitHub at [github.com/myurtoglu/cudaforengineers](https://github.com/myurtoglu/cudaforengineers){:target="_blank"}.

All projects include Linux/OS X Makefiles and Visual Studio 2013 project files. In order to be able to build all the projects succesfully, CUDA Toolkit 7.5 or above must be present on your system.

Please let us know through the comments if you see any issues in the code.
